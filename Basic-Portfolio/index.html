          The picture is my bitmoji, representing the real me.</br><br>

          My name is Olivia Yang and I am a senior in the University of Minnesota
          Twin-Cities majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychology. I like
          fishing and horror movies. (The Haunting of Hill House on Netflix is gooood
          although it is not a movie)
          I like coding when I know how to debug haha.
          I also love Virtual Reality. Luckily I am doing research in the VR lab on
          campus. We construct VR environment and design experiments to study how
          human perceive space,distance and depth in VR.

          My favorite music band is BlackPink and they are a girls music band in South
          Korea. BLΛƆKPIИK (블랙핑크) is a South Korean girl group under YG Entertainment.
          They officially debuted on August 8, 2016, releasing their two-song EP titled Square One,
          featuring the tracks BOOMBAYAH and Whistle.
          The two tracks charted at number one and two on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart,
          and Blackpink are by far the fastest act to do so. Following the success of Square One,
          they released their second single album Square Two, with the tracks Playing with Fire and Stay on November 1, 2016.
          They debuted in 2016 as the first girl group to debut under YG Entertainment in 7 years after 2NE1.
          The group has a versatile sound, ranging from YG’s signature hardcore hip-hop to slower songs bordering on A-town trap.
          The group consists of 4 members.
          Here are some songs you need to listen to:<br>
          Play with fire<br>
          As if its your last<br>
          Stay<br>
          Forever young<br>
          So hot<br>
          Whistle<br>
          Boombayah<br>
